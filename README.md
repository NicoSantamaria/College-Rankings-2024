# College-Rankings-2024
Current popular college rankings emphasize financial outcomes, selectivity, and prestige in their criteria. Thus, colleges which funnel students from privileged backgrounds into select industries such as technology and financial services rise to the top.

I am currently working on a college ranking which emphasizes educational quality and accessibility, reflecting the belief that the best college for a student is the college which challenges and educates them, and provides them the tools to pursue whichever career they choose -- regardless of how lucrative that chosen path may be.
